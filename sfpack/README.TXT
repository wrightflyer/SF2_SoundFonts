SFPACK VERSION 1.0.0.4
----------------------
SFPack is the ultimate solution in SoundFont packing, unrivaled in compression ratio and easiness of use. It beats hands down any other product (like sfArk, WaveZip, WinRar or WinZip).


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
SFPack runs on Win95/WinNT 4 (with at least Internet Explorer 4 installed) or Win98. A video card running either in HiColor or TrueColor mode is recommended.


INSTALLATION
------------
SFPack does not come with a setup program (this is for the reason that a setup program would add about 500 KB to the package size).
To install SFPack, simply extract sfpack.zip to any folder on your system (preferable you should create a folder in your program files tree). Then just start SFPack.exe and everything is done!


UNINSTALL
---------
To completely remove SFPack from your system, open the Add/Remove programs dialog in your Control Panel, select SFPack from the list and press the Add/Remove button. Now you can delete all the files of the SFPack package.
